# Team Orange ISD

This is a project

## Requirements

- Python
- Node Package Manager

## Setup

Our main development IDE is PyCharm, which handles Python dependancy installation automatically. However if you want to install the dependancies manually, we are using Virtualenv.

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Front-end dependancies and builds are handled with NPM and Grunt. Make sure you have both installed.

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt
```
